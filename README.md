PlinkoChallenge is a full-stack web application featuring a physics-based ball-dropping game implemented using HTML5 Canvas and TypeScript. I accomplished realistic physics simulation as measured by accurate collision detection and momentum preservation, creating an engaging and authentic gaming experience. I accomplished seamless multiplayer functionality by implementing real-time communication through Socket.IO, allowing users to compete and interact in live gaming sessions. I accomplished comprehensive user management by integrating a robust authentication system with virtual wallet functionality, enabling secure transactions and account management. I accomplished monetization optimization through an advanced advertisement rotation system that maximizes revenue while maintaining user experience quality. The platform serves as a well-built full-stack gaming environment with integrated wallet systems, administrative controls, advertising mechanisms, and user account management, providing a complete gaming ecosystem powered by MongoDB for reliable data persistence and scalability.
